Notes on Future Work:
Weather
	Extrapolation from data
	Robust (simulation for a constructed set of weather series)

Simulation
	Various ways to reduce run time if needed (time steps, number of runs)

Optimisation
	Evolutionairy Algorithms
	Use kerkhove dedicated search to find base solutions for local search

Schedule restrictions
	Have off and on months combined with early start bonus (so there is generation over off months) (with NPV)
	Vessel renting limitations and costs
